# BlazorServerApp_NewsPortal
A sample and simple #SPA signle page application using Microsoft ASP.NET Core Blazor Server App | By Dr. Amir Mohammad Shahsavarani

in order to use, you are requirder to put all the folders together and just run "BlazorServer_DB.sln" file!
Note that, you need to unzip the BlazorServer_DB and pu its folder alongside other folders.
I will gradually improve it and make som update, especialli in Authorization issues.

The package contains several features such as:
- Entity framework core & an elaborate database
- CKEditor
- Frontend free and opensource theme(works really)
- AutoMapper
- FormValidation
- EditForm
- IJsRuntime (implementing JavaScript)
- Toastr
- SweetAlert
- ImageUpload
- FileUpload
- Modal implementation
- Identity
- Pagination
- Search Resualt Filters
  and many more fantastic fabulous features of Blazor realm.

Essentially, I have seen this sample project as a very beginning journy into the deep forest of Microsoft ASP.NET Core Blazor 
Hope you will enjoy it, too.
